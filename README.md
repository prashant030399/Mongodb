Introduction
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers flexibility in data storage and management. This repository provides hands-on examples and best practices for working with MongoDB, covering fundamental concepts like CRUD operations as well as advanced topics such as aggregation, transactions, and schema design. Each project in this repository has been created using MongoDB and its integration with JavaScript or Node.js.

Prerequisites
Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

MongoDB: Install MongoDB
Node.js: Download and Install Node.js
npm: Node.js package manager (should come with Node.js)
MongoDB Compass (Optional): For visual interaction with your MongoDB databases.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mongodb-projects.git
cd mongodb-projects
Install the required dependencies (for projects involving Node.js):

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up a MongoDB connection:

Ensure your MongoDB server is running locally or connect to a cloud database (MongoDB Atlas).
Update the connection string in the project files as needed.
Project Overview
1. Basic CRUD Operations
This project demonstrates how to perform basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations in MongoDB. It includes examples using the MongoDB shell as well as programmatic interactions using Node.js.

Features:
Inserting documents
Querying data using filters
Updating and deleting records
Basic indexing
Directory: basic-crud/
2. Aggregation Framework
Learn how to use MongoDBâ€™s powerful aggregation framework for data analysis and reporting. This project covers pipeline stages like $match, $group, $project, and more.

Features:
Filtering and transforming data
Grouping and summarizing results
Performing complex queries
Directory: aggregation-framework/
3. Indexing and Performance
This project focuses on indexing strategies to improve query performance. It demonstrates how to create indexes, analyze query performance, and optimize database performance for large datasets.

Features:
Creating indexes
Analyzing query execution time
Compound and unique indexes
Directory: indexing-performance/
4. Schema Design Best Practices
Learn the best practices for designing efficient MongoDB schemas. This project includes examples of embedding versus referencing data, handling relationships, and designing for scalability.

Features:
Embedding vs. referencing
Schema flexibility and document design
Managing relationships between documents
Directory: schema-design/
5. MongoDB with Node.js
A full-fledged project showing how to integrate MongoDB with Node.js. It includes basic APIs for performing CRUD operations, along with an example of connecting to a cloud database using MongoDB Atlas.

Features:
Setting up a MongoDB connection with Node.js
Creating APIs for CRUD operations
Best practices for error handling and async/await
Directory: mongodb-nodejs/
6. MongoDB Transactions
Understand how to use multi-document transactions in MongoDB for consistent data operations. This project demonstrates how to ensure atomicity across multiple operations.

Features:
Using session for transactions
Committing and aborting transactions
Error handling in transactions
Directory: transactions/
How to Run the Programs
Ensure your MongoDB server is running:

bash
Copy code
mongod
Navigate to the specific project directory and run the JavaScript or Node.js program:

bash
Copy code
cd basic-crud
node index.js
For Node.js projects, update the .env file with your MongoDB connection string if required.
